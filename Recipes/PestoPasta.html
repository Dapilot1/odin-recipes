Turn off the heat and reserve at least ¼ cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta in a colander and let it cool for 1 minute.

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Toss in a mixing bowl</b> - When mixing the pasta and pesto together, make sure to use a mixing bowl rather than just mixing in the post. The pot is too hot and will cause the basil in the pesto to turn black.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>How to customize</b> - You can customize this penne pasta by adding in cooked meat or vegetables such as chicken, shrimp, zucchini, or broccoli.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>How to serve</b> - Serve pesto penne pasta with a side of crusty garlicky bread such as pull apart garlic bread, rosemary garlic focaccia bread, ciabatta bread, or tomato focaccia bread. You can also pair it with a fresh salad on the side such as an easy Greek salad, Mediterranean chickpea wedge salad, or tomato cucumber avocado salad.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>How to store</b> - Pesto pasta is best served fresh or cold as a pasta salad. Store any leftovers an airtight container for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. I would not recommend reheating, as this will also cause the basil to turn black when heated. You can serve leftovers as a delicious pasta salad.
