        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>How to store:</b> Allow leftover chicken penne pasta to cool in the pan or in a container with the lid off. Once the pasta reaches room temperature, place it in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. If you don’t allow it to cool before covering, the pasta can become mushy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>How to reheat:</b> Reheat in a pan on the stove over medium-low heat until warmed through. If the sauce has thickened too much in the fridge, add a splash of water. You can also reheat in the microwave in 30 second increments until warmed through.
